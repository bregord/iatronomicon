## Heparin
### History

Heparin was discovered by a medical student working with dog livers. 


Basically, it's just a polysaccharide chain that activates antithrombin
Antithrombin is a Serine Protease inhibitor. RTargets Thrombin, FXa. It binds to them, and then targets it for degradation. 

UFH accelerates the mode of action of antithrombin by 1000 times

### Vitamin K Antagonist

Interesting story. 1930s, Karl Paul Link was investigating a massacre of cattle on farms surrounding the University of Wisconsin.

Basically, the cows were fed spoiled hay after a few wet summers. Spoiled hay contains sweet clover, which contains dicumarol. 
Dicumarol inhibits vitamin K, by competing with Vitamin K reductase. Vitamin K reductase recycles vitamin K.

All vitamin K inhibitors work like this. They stop the enzyme that recycles, which causes Vitamin K level to decrease over time.

And a drug was derived from dicumarol. A drug we call warfarin.
