## First, Rule Out Non-Metabolic Causes
- Autoimmune
- Infections - Hep A, B, C, EBV
- Toxins
	- Paracetamol, Tyleno, etc.
- Prolonged TPN
- Hypothyroidism
- Extrahepatic Biliary Disease

## Overall Effect of Inherited Diseases
They affect
- Hepatic Cell integrity
	- e.g. Wilson, A1AT, 
- Cholestrol Biosynthesis Pathways
- Liver Structure

### Age of Presenation
- 3 months - conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
- Unconjugated 
	- Hemolytic Anemia
	- Crigler-Naijar
	- Gilbert Syndrome
	- Rotor Syndrome 

In a newborn, DIRECT IS ALWAYS PATHOLOGIC. Indirect has other casues (breastfeeding ec)

If direct is greater than 20% of indirect
## Firstline Investigations
