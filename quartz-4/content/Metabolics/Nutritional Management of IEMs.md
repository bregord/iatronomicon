## Nutrition Therapy
- Modification to a diet usually invovles removing a certian macronutrient
	- Carbohydrates
	- Protein
	- Fat
## Three Types of Disorders
A practical approach to IEMs.
- Disorders of Intoxication
- Disorders of Energy Metabolism
	- e,g, Congenital Lactic acidemia
	- 
- Diisorders of Complex Molecules

### Disorders of Intoxication
Aka small moleculte disorders. **MOST ARE TREATABLE**
- Organic acidurias
- Urea cycle disorders
- Amino acidemias

As a general rule, these often have no prenatal concerns and tend to affect cterm infants after a free interval. People present with acute episodes in the context of chronic recurrent intoxications
## Amino Acid Disorders
People can't metabolize one or several amino acids. It follows naturally that you should restrict it -> so decrease protein intake or, consider the use of Analog FOrmula, Medical Foods.

**Analog Formula** - has an amino acid base with removal of the offending amino acid. As en example, Phenyl free has no phenylalanine.

**Medical Foods** - foods modified to have low protein - pasta, bread, rice, baking mix etc.

However, consider that catabolism occurs in starvation states - and people mobilize their body's protein stores which have amino acids. **Adequate caloric intake is necessary for all amino acid disorders**. What's more, is that daily recommended intakes are needed when you provide single amino acids rather than proteins. 

Micronutrients are alo importabt - Iron, Zinc, Calcium, Selenium, Vitamin D, and B12 are of the greatest concern as these patents can have a limited diet or reduced bioavailability


### Protein Content of Foods
We think of protein being in foods like meat, legumes, peanut butter etc. However, a lot of foods no typically thought of as having foods with protein DO HAVE PROTEIN (just a lot less)

E.g.


| Food Group | Grams of Protein |
| ---------- | ---------------- |
| Fruit      | <1g per 1/2 cup  |
| Vegetables |                  |
| pasta      |                  |

## Monitoring Therapy Success
- Growth
- Nutritional Intake
- Biochemical parameters
- Tolerance and Acceptance

## Sick Day Management
Metabolic stress and intercurrent illness or infection can precipitate decompensation and cause complications

Patients wiht metablic diseases will often decompensate when sick, and maintaining nutrition is paramount. Often need an NG, IV glucose, and occasioanlly measures like lipid infusions.

Management can also depend on the type of disorder.
E.g.
- Amino Acid Disorders - amino acid formula + protein free powder
	- BUT ONLY protein free for 24 hours - if you're deficient in essential amino acids for 24 hours catabolism will begin


### Specific Disorders
#### PKU
